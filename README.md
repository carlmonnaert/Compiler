# Compiling/interpreting in RISK-V tools for a set of simplified programming languages such as Python and C



## Getting started
You will find **3 subprojects** in this repository :
- An interpreter for a simplified version of Python (that we called PtiPython), which interprets Python code in C
- A C compiler for RISK-V architectures for a tiny version of C (that we called microC)
- A C compiler for RISK-V architectures handlind the main features of the C language (such as pointers).
